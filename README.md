# Sketch Project README

## Description

This sketch project recreates an image with specific requirements using the p5.js library. It consists of various functions to draw different elements while preserving relative dimensions. Additionally, it allows toggling the tint on the top image with a mouse click.

## Requirements

1. Each section of the image should be drawn in its own function.
   - `drawBorders`, `drawWave`, `drawImage`, and `drawShapes`.

2. Each function should be parameterized for reusability.
3. The entire sketch is surrounded by a 10-pixel wide white border.
4. The canvas can handle various sizes, but there may be issues with extreme aspect ratios.
5. The yellow line is centered vertically.
6. The wave is drawn using Bezier curves with specific properties.
7. The image is positioned and tinted cyan as per the requirements.
8. Shapes include an ellipse, rectangle, and trapezoid, each meeting specific criteria.

## Usage

1. Open the sketch in a compatible p5.js editor or IDE.
2. Run the sketch to see the recreated image.
3. Click the mouse button to toggle the tint on the top image on and off.

## Implementation

- The sketch is implemented using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding.
- Various functions handle different elements to ensure modularity and maintainability.
- Mouse interaction is used to toggle the image tint.
